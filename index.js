/*Task 1: counterMaker()
  
  Study the code for counter1 and counter2, then answer the questions below.
  
  1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?
      The counterMaker function, uses function scoped variables and returns the result of the function. Whereas function counter2, uses global variables and does not have closure meaning that it will return the same number every time because the variable will be reset when it is passed back into the function. 

  2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?
      Function one uses closure, it has contained within it another 'nested' function. 
  3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would 
     counter2 be better?  
      counter2 would be useful if you were hoisting your work, so that you can declare your variables first and then have your functions later on.

/* ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è Task 2: inning() ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è
Use the inning function below to do the following:
  1. Return a random whole number of points between 0 and 2 scored by one team in an inning
  
  For example: invoking inning() should return a numerical score value of 0, 1, or 2
  
NOTE: This will be a callback function for the tasks below

Use the finalScore function below to do the following:
  1. Receive the callback function `inning` that was created in Task 2 
  2. Receive a (number) of (innings) to be played- (parameters.)
  3. After each inning, update the score of the home and away teams - what the function would do. 
  4. After the last inning, return an object containing the final (total) score of the innings played--- output
  
  For example: invoking finalScore(inning, 9) might return this object:
{
  "Home": 11,
  "Away": 5

  2. Return an object with a score for (home) and a (score )for away that populates from invoking the inning callback function variables*/

/* ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è Task 5: scoreboard() ‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è‚öæÔ∏è
Use the scoreboard function below to do the following:
  1. Receive the callback function `getInningScore` from Task 4-parameter
  2. Receive the callback function `inning` from Task 2 -parameter
  3. Receive a number of innings to be played -parameter
  4. Return an array where each of it's index values equals a string stating the blank array[scores]
  Home and Away team's scores for each inning.  Not the cumulative score.-- the function should not add but catalogue the scores from each inning.
  5. (If) there's a tie at the end of the innings, add this message containing the score to the end of the array:  "This game will require extra innings: Away 12 - Home 12"  (see tie example below)- should be an if statement   tie "This game will require extra innings: Away 12 - Home 12"
     If there isn't a tie, add this message to the end of the array: "Final Score: Away 13 - Home 11"  (see no tie example below)
 
  NO TIE example: invoking scoreboard(getInningScore,inning, 9) might return 
  an array of strings like this:
